<h1><u<>Paragraph 1</u></h1>
	<p font="color:red" size:"30" face="arial">It is hard to imagine a life without color. The truth is we don’t all exactly know the colors that someone else sees. We all probably see colors a little differently, different shades, different tones, and hues. We know that color blindness exists and some people cannot see colors and instead live in a world of muted colors. Almost more terrifying to me than color blindness would be living in a world of hyper-color. Where every color appeared neon and fluorescent. Could you imagine, only being able to escape bright, burning colors by closing your eyes?</p><br>

<h1>Paragraph 2</h1>
	<p><u>Color communicates so much. It has the power to convey moods and feelings like when people say, “He was green with envy,” “I’m feeling blue” or “She was red hot, she was so mad.” Color is used to organize life and bring order, like stop lights, or yellow versus white directional stripes on the road, or when some very organized people color code things everything from books to tupperware.</u></p><br>
